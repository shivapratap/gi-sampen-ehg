"""Unrounded / full-precision control: verifies the paper's mechanism claim.

`full_precision_summaries` removes the fixed-decimal rounding entirely (no
sd-standardisation either): the tolerance axis is the raw, data-adaptive set
of unique unrounded pairwise Chebyshev distances. Because that axis is
data-adaptive rather than fixed, the cumulative pair-count at each rank is
unchanged by any positive rescaling of the signal (rescaling relabels the
axis but preserves the ordering of distances), so the profile -- and every
summary of it -- is EXACTLY invariant to gain, with no standardisation step
at all.

The paper's own report (results/audits/full_precision_gain_test_report.md)
states this in its own vocabulary as "exactly gain-equivariant": 0.000e+00
deviation for fp_total, fp_average and fp_sd at every tested gain, well
within atol=1e-08, rtol=1e-06. This test file reproduces that finding,
including its terminology.

Read together with test_gain_invariance.py, this is the paper's central
mechanism-isolating result (facts_pack.md, section 5.5): removing the
fixed-decimal ROUNDING is what restores invariance, standardisation is a
separate, additional feature-definition change made by the GI variants. This
is "the single strongest answer to the 'this is just a bug in one
implementation' objection" (facts_pack.md), so this test is written to fail
loudly, not silently degrade, if that stops holding.

Needs no external data.
